## Wordlists
Lists of common words used for testing passwords strength.

**Note**: The file **common_names.txt** was originally downloaded from [H4CKR Github repository](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker) and then all names where converted to lowercase.


## Reference
Different files I found interesting and copied here to prevent them from disappearing from their current sites.

**Note**: The reference for HostApd (WiFi configuration) was originally downloaded from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/freebsd/head/contrib/wpa/hostapd/hostapd.conf).
